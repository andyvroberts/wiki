### Admitted Market (US)
Each US state has local insurance companies.  No Lloyds syndicates participate in admitted lines today.  If the local market cannot place a risk, it can be designated as Surplus Lines business.

### Excess
The monetary amount deducted from each claim.  Usually, this amount is voluntary and results in a lower premium.

### Line of Busines (LOB)
A categorisation that groups insured risks.  Maybe for regulatory, geographic, risk assessment or other analytic purposes.  Less strictly defined then Class and not to be confused with the signed line of a Lineslip.  
Common examples include P&C (property and casualty) or CGL (commerical general liability).

### Open Market
Traditional Broker led insurance placements.  Includes both individual and Subscription Business.

### Peril
An event that causes a loss, for example an explosion or a flood.  A Hazzard is a condition which effects or influences a Peril, for example storage of chemicals.  
Perils can be named in an insurance Policy, however a peril does not need to be explicitly stated for it to be Covered.

### Subscription Business
The London Market is a subscription market. Multiple insurers can each share a percentage of a risk (depending on their available capacity).  They will receive that percentage of Premium and will be liable for that percentage of any claims.

### Surplus Lines (US)
Lloyds syndicates or insurance companies can conduct direct business within US states only after meeting certain criteria for non-local insurers.
